Evan Behrens

I am majoring in statistics and minoring in Data Science and Economics.
I am learning probabilities and other applications of statistics like forecasting. In Data science we are learning how to use data. 
The three things I use to be organized is a calander to write due dates on, a pencil and eraser so if I make a mistake I can erase it, and a watch so I know what time it is if I need to do something else.
